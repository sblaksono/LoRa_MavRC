MAVLink Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library

This is a library for lightweight communication between
Micro Air Vehicles (swarm) and/or ground control stations.

It serializes C-structs for serial channels and can be used with
any type of radio modem.

To generate/update packets, select mavlink/message_definitions/mavlink_standard_message.xml
in the QGroundControl station settings view, select mavlink as
the output directory and click on "Save and Generate".
You will find the newly generated/updated message_xx.h files in
the mavlink/generated folder.

To use MAVLink, #include the <mavlink.h> file, not the individual
message files. In some cases you will have to add the main folder to the include search path as well. To be safe, we recommend these flags:

gcc -I mavlink -I mavlink/<your message set, e.g. common>
